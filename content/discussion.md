k-Means does not consider network connectivity, METIS does not consider location

Own creation

- prio
  - simple chunks of varying size
- merged
  - irregular shapes of varying size
- metis
  - irregular shapes of equal size

Is it even desirable to use highly balanced clusters? Does that reflect how the data is used?
