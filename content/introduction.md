## Introduction

The [Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/) defines open data as data that can be: "... freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose". This may seem utopian, but these principles are being adopted all over the world. The OECD has documented the positive impact of [Open Government Data](cite:cites oecd), and similar ideas have surfaced in academics with the [FAIR Data Principles](cite:cites fair) where a common guideline is to make data ["As open as possible as possible, as closed as necessary"](cite:cites landi2019fair). 

Consider the case of someone who is looking to buy a house, and the quality of service of wheelchair accessible public transit is important to them. A real estate site could include this information in their item listings, but only if they can find and access relevant datasets. Luckily, many public transit operators publish their timetables as open data. This is often done using de facto standards such as General Transit Feed Specification [(GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs) or using official standards such as Network Timetable Exchange [(NeTEx)](http://netex-cen.eu/). However, these data standards result in large data dumps: the combined GTFS feed of the public transit companies that operate in the Brussels area (SNCB, STIB, De Lijn, and Tec) is already over 1 GB of uncompressed data. A hobbyist developer that wants use a Raspberry Pi to show a dashboard of bus passages near them can run into issues ingesting and processing all this data. 

Another use case for open transit data is route planning. The ideal route is subjective; a reasonable walking distance differs from person to person, and even depends on a person's mood. Contemporary route planning services preprocess data to provide better query time performance [](cite:citesAsEvidence googlemaps, ch, csa), but this preprocessing also restricts the types of queries that can be answered. For example, an algorithm that reuses precomputed shortest paths between stops will not be able to give you the most scenic path -- unless those are precomputed as well. But what if you could use your own device to calculate your own personalized routes? You could tweak journeys until you find exactly what you are looking for, without putting an unreasonable strain on a route planning service. This approach obviously comes with its own challenges, and ingesting data is again one of them. Downloading the entire dataset on your phone to plan a route from one adjacent city to another is too slow to be practical. 

These examples show that the way data is published can restrict how the data can be used. What may be feasible for a corporation may not be feasible for a regular person, even though the idea of open data is to make the data usable by everyone.
