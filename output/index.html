      <!-- Context - bigger picture     -->
      <p>The more unique your mobility needs are, the less likely you are to find an existing data service that suits your needs. Therein lies the beauty of publishing the raw data; data owners don’t have to anticipate everyone’s needs if third parties can fill in the gaps.
<!-- Need - gap we try to solve   -->
Public transit operators often publish their data as a large data dump under the assumption that data consumers want to process the entire dataset anyway. Unfortunately, developers with limited computational resources can have trouble ingesting all this data. Linked Connections is an alternative publishing scheme that fragments the data by the connections’ departure times. This enables data consumers to be more selective in the data they choose to process. This is already a good improvement over monolithic data dumps, but each fragment still contains data from the entire operator’s service area.
<!-- Task - what we did           -->
We build upon the idea of Linked Connections by fragmenting geospatially as well as by departure time. Ideally, our publishing scheme must work in the case  where the data publisher is not the data owner. This means that the fragmentation method should be robust to changes in the original data, such as the deletion or the addition of stops. Contrary to the conventional approach of generating discrete sets of stops, we propose generating geospatial partitions instead. These partitions are published alongside the transit data itself, allowing data consumers to infer which fragments contain which data. 
<!-- Object       -->
In this paper we explore conventional clustering methods such as k-Means and METIS, alongside two simple methods of our own that are custom-tailored to public transit data. We compare the effectiveness of each for the use case of client-side route planning.
<!-- Findings     -->
Our results show that the number of generated partitions greatly affects the performance of route planning. Even with only 4 partitions queries get answered 2.2 times faster while also requiring 2.6 times less data, and 16 partitions already yield 4.4 times faster queries and 7.2 times less required data. Interestingly enough the choice of fragmentation strategy has less impact; a simple clustering method such as k-Means results in 5% faster queries than a complex method such as METIS.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These results show that data publishers don’t have to train the perfect clustering model – even a simple approach is effective. 
<!-- Perspectives -->
Consequently, this increases the likelihood that such a publishing scheme may be adopted.</p>

      <h2 property="schema:name">Introduction</h2>

      <p>The <a href="https://opendefinition.org/">Open Definition</a> defines open data as data that can be: “… freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose”. This may seem utopian, but these principles are being adopted all over the world. The OECD has documented the positive impact of <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" resource="https://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1787/5k46bj4f03s7-en"><a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/content/paper/5k46bj4f03s7-en">Open Government Data</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>, and similar ideas have surfaced in academics with the FAIR Data Principles <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span> where a common guideline is to make data “As open as possible as possible, as closed as necessary” <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>.</p>

      <p>Consider the case of someone who is looking to buy a house, and the quality of service of wheelchair accessible public transit is important to them. A real estate site could include this information in their item listings, but only if they can find and access relevant datasets. Luckily, many public transit operators publish their timetables as open data. This is often done using de facto standards such as General Transit Feed Specification <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs">(GTFS)</a> or using official standards such as Network Timetable Exchange <a href="http://netex-cen.eu/">(NeTEx)</a>. However, these data standards result in large data dumps: the combined GTFS feed of the public transit companies that operate in the Brussels area (SNCB, STIB, De Lijn, and Tec) is already over 1 GB of uncompressed data. A hobbyist developer that wants use a Raspberry Pi to show a dashboard of bus passages near them can run into issues ingesting and processing all this data.</p>

      <p>Another use case for open transit data is route planning. The ideal route is subjective; a reasonable walking distance differs from person to person, and even depends on a person’s mood. Contemporary route planning services preprocess data to provide better query time performance <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>, <a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span>, but this preprocessing also restricts the types of queries that can be answered. For example, an algorithm that reuses precomputed shortest paths between stops will not be able to give you the most scenic path – unless those are precomputed as well. But what if you could use your own device to calculate your own personalized routes? You could tweak journeys until you find exactly what you are looking for, without putting an unreasonable strain on a route planning service. This approach obviously comes with its own challenges, and ingesting data is again one of them. Downloading the entire dataset on your phone to plan a route from one adjacent city to another is too slow to be practical.</p>

      <p>These examples show that the way data is published can restrict how the data can be used. What may be feasible for a corporation may not be feasible for a regular person, even though the idea of open data is to make the data usable by everyone.</p>

      <h3 id="linked-data-fragments">Linked Data Fragments</h3>

      <p>Tim Berners-Lee outlined four principles of Linked Data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span>: 1) use URIs as names for things, 2) use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names, 3) when someone looks up a URI, provide useful information using standards such as RDF, and 4) include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things. In the conceptual framework of Linked Data Fragments <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span>, this is just one interface to access Linked Data. You could also publish the data as one large data dump, or provide a querying API on top of the data. What all these interfaces have in common is that they expose a <em>fragment</em> of the entire dataset, so they can all be considered Linked Data Fragments. Data dumps and query APIs are the two extremes on the Linked Data Fragments axis <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span>. This axis serves illustrates the trade-offs between different methods of publishing Linked Data on the Web. Data dumps put the data processing burden on the client’s side, but allow the most flexibility for clients. Query APIs on the other hand put the processing burden on the server side but always restrict, in some way, the way the data can be used.</p>

      <h3 id="mobility-data">Mobility Data</h3>

      <p>The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is, at the time of writing, the de facto standard for publishing public transit schedules. A single feed is a combination of 6 to 13 CSV files, compressed into a single ZIP archive. Its core data elements are stops, routes, trips, and stop times. Stops are places where vehicles pick up or drop off riders, routes are two or more stops that form a public transit line, trips correspond to a physical vehicle that follows a route during a specific time period, and stop times indicate when a trip passes by a stop. This data is not only useful for route planning applications, other applications include embedding timetables in mobile applications, data visualization; accessibility analysis, and planning analysis <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span>.</p>

      <p>The Linked Connections specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span> defines a way to publish transit data that falls somewhere in the middle of the Linked Data Fragments axis. Connections are defined as vehicles going from one stop to another without an intermediate halt. These connections are then ordered by departure time, fragmented into documents, and are then published over HTTP. Clients can use the semantics embedded in each fragment to solve their own queries. This, combined with the fact that each fragment is easily cacheable, make Linked Connections servers very scalable <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span>.</p>

      <h3 id="partitioning-public-transit-networks">Partitioning Public Transit Networks</h3>

      <p>Researchers in the field of route planning have noted that while methods based on partitioning have been successful for accelerating queries on road networks, adapting those methods to public transit networks is harder than expected <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-11">11</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>]</span>. One of the main differences is that road networks are, for the most part, topological networks. Public transit networks on the other hand are also inherently time-dependent, while road networks. On top of that, it is not even clear <em>what</em> exactly needs to be partitioned as different algorithms can require wildly different data models <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-13">13</a>]</span>.</p>

      <p>The Scalable Transfer Patterns <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-14">14</a>]</span> algorithm that aims to greatly reduce preprocessing times of the original Transfer Patterns <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-15">15</a>]</span> algorithm. The authors compared 4 different techniques to partition stops into clusters of roughly equal size: 1) k-Means using the stops’ geographical locations, 2) a merge-based clustering with a utility function that punishes big partitions and rewards pairs of partitions with high edge weights between them , 3) a general-purpose graph clustering algorithm called METIS <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-16">16</a>]</span>, and 4) a road partitioning method called PUNCH <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-17">17</a>]</span>. They found that k-Means, despite being completely oblivious to the network structure outperformed, outperformed both METIS and PUNCH while the merge-based approach performed the best of all. HypRAPTOR <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-13">13</a>]</span> is another route planning algorithm that uses METIS to partition the network graph, but it clusters trips instead of stops.</p>

      <h3 id="voronoi-diagrams">Voronoi Diagrams</h3>

      <p>Voronoi diagrams are one of the most fundamental data structures in computational geometry <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-18">18</a>]</span>. Although they can be applied to any metric space, we only consider Euclidean spaces in this paper for the sake of simplicity. Given a set of seed points in a Euclidean space, a Voronoi diagram partitions that space into regions so that each region contains exactly one seed point, and every point in a region is closer to that region’s seed point than to any other region’s. Formally this means that for a given Euclidean space <script type="math/tex">X</script> with distance function <script type="math/tex">d</script>, and a set of seed points <script type="math/tex">P \subset X</script>, each point <script type="math/tex">p_i \in P</script> yields a corresponding Voronoi region <script type="math/tex">R_i \subseteq X</script> where</p>

      <script type="math/tex; mode=display">R_i = \{ x \in X \mid d(x, p_i) \leq d(x, p_j) \text{ for all } i \neq j  \}</script>

      <p>The Linked Connections publishing scheme already a good job at enabling applications to ingest the most relevant data, but each fragment still contains data from the entire transit operator’s service area. <a href="#frequencies">Fig. 1</a> shows that some regions served by the Flemish public transit operator, De Lijn, are more popular than others, implying that it makes sense to fragment by location.</p>

      <p>However, first we should consider what is necessary to make publishing fragmented data viable in the real world. We make a distinction between data owners and data publishers, with a clear distinction between their responsibilities. A data owner focuses on maintaining the data quality, while a data publisher focuses on making the data accessible. Both roles come with their own challenges, and as such it is not uncommon for data owners to consult third parties to publish the data for them. This means that data publishers may not have control over the actual data – when the data changes they just have to follow. For example, public transit operators routinely add and remove temporary stops due to maintenance works, and these changes have to be reflected in the published data with as little friction as possible.</p>

      <h3 id="data">Data</h3>

      <p>Lead by the insights provided by <a href="#frequencies">Fig. 1</a>, we will focus on Flemish public transit network for the remainder of this paper.  Flanders is a small region within Europe, but with 487 inhabitans/km² in 2019 it is also one of the most densely populated <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-19">19</a>]</span>. The public transit network is equally dense; at the time of writing there are 35,791 stops spread out over 13,522 km² for a stops density of 2.6 stops/km². There are roughly 1 billion connections on a regular weekday, and the corresponding Linked Connections data results in over 10 billion RDF triples per day.  We use one data from the first whole week of December as the base data in the rest of this section.</p>

      <h3 id="clustering">Clustering</h3>

      <p>Existing work has focused on clustering stops, or trips, into discrete sets of objects. This means that any time a new stop gets added by the data owner, the data publisher must explicitly label the new stop as well. For clustering algorithms such as k-Means this is relatively easy, but for algorithms such as METIS this means recomputing the entire clustering. Instead of coming up with another clustering algorithms that is easy to update, we propose to publish the clusters differently. Instead of creating discrete sets of stops, we partition the physical world. The resulting partitions are published as separate resources, allowing any agent to infer to which cluster every stop belongs. In other words, data publishers do not have to explicitly label every stop themselves – the data speaks for itself.</p>

Note that the two methods on the top row create regions of roughly equal sizes, while the approaches at the bottom create regions of varying sizes. The approaches in the left column create regions with simple shapes, while the ones on the right create irregular shapes.</figcaption>
</figure>

      <h4 id="k-means">k-Means</h4>

      <p>Although k-Means is a simple algorithm, existing work has found it to be competitive with more complex methods <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-14">14</a>]</span>, so we consider it among the state of the art for this particular use-case. As the name implies, this clustering distributes a given set of points in exactly <script type="math/tex">k</script> clusters, where every point belongs to cluster with the nearest cluster mean. Iterative heuristics exist to compute this clustering, we used the implementation from <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/0.20/modules/clustering.html#k-means">scikit.learn 0.20.3</a> with default parameters, and using the stops’ WGS84 coordinates as input. To obtain to wanted spatial partitioning we create a Voronoi diagram using the cluster means as seed points. Because the Voronoi cells of two adjacent points on the convex hull share an infinitely long edge, we add some extra padding points that represent the bounding box of the operator’s service area – and then discard all infinite edges.</p>

      <h4 id="metis">METIS</h4>

      <p>METIS is another algorithm that is used to partition public transit networks <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-13">13</a>, <a href="#ref-14">14</a>]</span>, so we consider it to be the state of the art as well. Since it is a graph clustering algorithm, we must represent the public transit network as a graph. We follow the conventional approach of creating a vertex for every stop, and connecting them with an edge if they are connected through a single connection. Every edge is assigned a weight that corresponds to how many connections connect those stops. We used <a href="https://metis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python wrapper</a> to compute the clustering, using the <code>contig</code> option to force contiguous partitions.</p>

      <p>The METIS algorith only sees the network as a connectivity graph though – it does not know anything about the physical location of the stops. This means that even though it creates contiguous partitions, those partitions aren’t contiguous in the physical world. We obtain a clean spatial partitioning using an additional post-processing step that 1) creates the Voronoi diagram of all stops, 2) merges all Voronoi cells that belong to the same cluster, and 3) merge isolated rings into the encompassing cluster.</p>

      <h4 id="prio">Prio</h4>

      <p>Both k-Means and METIS are general purpose clustering techniques, and both ignore an important feature of the data: k-Means does not consider network connectivity and METIS does not consider physical locations. Although the main goal of this paper is not to find a better clustering technique, we were curious how a simple domain-specific approach compares to traditional methods.</p>

      <p>The algorithm iteratively selects the stops based on which trips pass through it. In the first iteration it selects the stop with the most unique trips, in the subsequent iterations it selects the stop with the most unique trips that the previous stop(s) did not have. As there is a finite amount of trips, this algorithm has a clear termination condition: when all trips are covered by one of the selected stops. After <script type="math/tex">k</script> iterations it contains the $k$ most important hubs, which lead us to name this method <em>prio</em>. These selected stops are then used as seed points to create a Voronoi diagram. <a href="#prio">Fig. 3</a> contains all the necessary code to implement this, up until the creation of the Voronoi diagram.</p>

      <h4 id="merged">Merged</h4>

      <p>Instead of stopping the previous algorithm after <script type="math/tex">k</script> iterations we can also let it terminate, and then use the Jaccard similarity coefficient to merge the two most similar adjacent Voronoi regions until only <script type="math/tex">k</script> remain. This makes the process more complex, but existing work has shown good results using hierarchical clustering techniques <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-14">14</a>]</span>.</p>

      <h3 id="hypermedia-controls">Hypermedia Controls</h3>

      <p>The obtained Voronoi regions are published to the web as stand-alone resources using the Hydra and GeoSPARQL vocabularies. The Hydra in this case is used to describe a partitioning as a collection of regions, and the <code>wktLiteral</code> datatype from the GeoSPARQL vocabulary is used to describe individual regions. GeoJSON is another common way to define geometries, but since GeoJSON polygons are incompatible with JSON-LD we chose to use a simple string representation: WKT. <a href="#partitionresource">Fig. 4</a> contains a JSON-LD snippet of a single partition resource.</p>

      <p>These partition resources are then be used to fragment Linked Connections data. This separation allows for reusing existing partitions, such as administrative regions. A modified Linked Connections server can ingest a given partitioning, and fragment the data accordingly. The server creates one <code>hydra:PartialCollectionView</code> instance per region, and then creates an index of all generated views using the <a href="https://github.com/pietercolpaert/TreeOntology"><code>tree</code></a> ontology. This ontology is used to link every view to the resource that describes a geospatial area. <a href="#partioncontrols">Fig. 5</a> contains a JSON-LD snippet of such an index.</p>

      <h3 id="cacheability">Cacheability</h3>

      <p>no considerable change in total data size, so a cache that is big enough to cache the original data can also cache the partitioned data</p>

      <p>One thing that does change is how fast the cache will fill up - you need at least one request per fragment to fill up a web cache.</p>

      <p>The different partitioning schemes will also diverge when the cache is too small to contain all the data. Filling a cache with fine-grained data will take longer, but the cached data is more likely to be relevant. For example, a purely temporal fragmentation strategy will contain data for the entire operator’s service area, even if one region is significantly less often requested.</p>

      <p>To evaluate how fast a cache is filled we replay a small amount of requests on an empty cache, and do this many times. To evaluate how often relevant data is evicted from the cache we do the same, but on an already warmed up cache.</p>
