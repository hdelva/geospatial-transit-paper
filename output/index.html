      <!-- Context - bigger picture     -->
      <p>The more unique your mobility needs are, the less likely you are to find an existing data service that suits your needs. Therein lies the beauty of publishing the raw data; data owners don’t have to anticipate everyone’s needs if third parties can fill in the gaps.
<!-- Need - gap we try to solve   -->
Public transit operators often publish their data as a large data dump under the assumption that data consumers want to process the entire dataset anyway. Unfortunately, developers with limited computational resources can have trouble ingesting all this data. Linked Connections is an alternative publishing scheme that fragments the data by the connections’ departure times. This enables data consumers to be more selective in the data they choose to process. This is already a good improvement over monolithic data dumps, but each fragment still contains data from the entire operator’s service area.
<!-- Task - what we did           -->
We build upon the idea of Linked Connections by fragmenting geospatially as well as by departure time. Ideally, our publishing scheme must work in the case  where the data publisher is not the data owner. This means that the fragmentation method should be robust to changes in the original data, such as the deletion or the addition of stops. Contrary to the conventional approach of generating discrete sets of stops, we propose generating geospatial partitions instead. These partitions are published alongside the transit data itself, allowing data consumers to infer which fragments contain which data. 
<!-- Object       -->
In this paper we explore conventional clustering methods such as k-Means and METIS, alongside two simple methods of our own that are custom-tailored to public transit data. We compare the effectiveness of each for the use case of client-side route planning.
<!-- Findings     -->
Our results show that the number of generated partitions greatly affects the performance of route planning. Even with only 4 partitions queries get answered 2.2 times faster while also requiring 2.6 times less data, and 16 partitions already yield 4.4 times faster queries and 7.2 times less required data. Interestingly enough the choice of fragmentation strategy has less impact; a simple clustering method such as k-Means results in 5% faster queries than a complex method such as METIS.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These results show that data publishers don’t have to train the perfect clustering model – even a simple approach is effective. 
<!-- Perspectives -->
Consequently, this increases the likelihood that such a publishing scheme may be adopted.</p>

      <h2 property="schema:name">Introduction</h2>

      <p>The <a href="https://opendefinition.org/">Open Definition</a> defines open data as data that can be: “… freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose”. This may seem utopian, but these principles are being adopted all over the world. The OECD has documented the positive impact of <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" resource="https://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1787/5k46bj4f03s7-en"><a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/content/paper/5k46bj4f03s7-en">Open Government Data</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>, and similar ideas have surfaced in academics with the FAIR Data Principles <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span> where a common guideline is to make data “As open as possible as possible, as closed as necessary” <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>.</p>

      <p>Consider the case of someone who is looking to buy a house, and the quality of service of wheelchair accessible public transit is important to them. A real estate site could include this information in their item listings, but only if they can find and access relevant datasets. Luckily, many public transit operators publish their timetables as open data. This is often done using de facto standards such as General Transit Feed Specification <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs">(GTFS)</a> or using official standards such as Network Timetable Exchange <a href="http://netex-cen.eu/">(NeTEx)</a>. However, these data standards result in large data dumps: the combined GTFS feed of the public transit companies that operate in the Brussels area (SNCB, STIB, De Lijn, and Tec) is already over 1 GB of uncompressed data. A hobbyist developer that wants use a Raspberry Pi to show a dashboard of bus passages near them can run into issues ingesting and processing all this data.</p>

      <p>Another use case for open transit data is route planning. The ideal route is subjective; a reasonable walking distance differs from person to person, and even depends on a person’s mood. Contemporary route planning services preprocess data to provide better query time performance <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>, <a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span>, but this preprocessing also restricts the types of queries that can be answered. For example, an algorithm that reuses precomputed shortest paths between stops will not be able to give you the most scenic path – unless those are precomputed as well. But what if you could use your own device to calculate your own personalized routes? You could tweak journeys until you find exactly what you are looking for, without putting an unreasonable strain on a route planning service. This approach obviously comes with its own challenges, and ingesting data is again one of them. Downloading the entire dataset on your phone to plan a route from one adjacent city to another is too slow to be practical.</p>

      <p>These examples show that the way data is published can restrict how the data can be used. What may be feasible for a corporation may not be feasible for a regular person, even though the idea of open data is to make the data usable by everyone.</p>

      <h3 id="linked-data-fragments">Linked Data Fragments</h3>

      <p>Tim Berners-Lee outlined four principles of Linked Data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span>: 1) use URIs as names for things, 2) use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names, 3) when someone looks up a URI, provide useful information using standards such as RDF, and 4) include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things. In the conceptual framework of Linked Data Fragments <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span>, this is just one interface to access Linked Data. You could also publish the data as one large data dump, or provide a querying API on top of the data. What all these interfaces have in common is that they expose a <em>fragment</em> of the entire dataset, so they can all be considered Linked Data Fragments. Data dumps and query APIs are the two extremes on the Linked Data Fragments axis <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span>. This axis serves illustrates the trade-offs between different methods of publishing Linked Data on the Web. Data dumps put the data processing burden on the client’s side, but allow the most flexibility for clients. Query APIs on the other hand put the processing burden on the server side but always restrict, in some way, the way the data can be used.</p>

      <h3 id="mobility-data">Mobility Data</h3>

      <p>The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is, at the time of writing, the de facto standard for publishing public transit schedules. A single feed is a combination of 6 to 13 CSV files, compressed into a single ZIP archive. Its core data elements are stops, routes, trips, and stop times. Stops are places where vehicles pick up or drop off riders, routes are two or more stops that form a public transit line, trips correspond to a physical vehicle that follows a route during a specific time period, and stop times indicate when a trip passes by a stop. This data is not only useful for route planning applications, other applications include embedding timetables in mobile applications, data visualization; accessibility analysis, and planning analysis <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span>.</p>

      <p>The Linked Connections specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span> defines a way to publish transit data that falls somewhere in the middle of the Linked Data Fragments axis. Connections are defined as vehicles going from one stop to another without an intermediate halt. These connections are then ordered by departure time, fragmented into documents, and are then published over HTTP. Clients can use the semantics embedded in each fragment to solve their own queries. This, combined with the fact that each fragment is easily cacheable, make Linked Connections servers very scalable <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span>.</p>

      <h3 id="partitioning-public-transit-networks">Partitioning Public Transit Networks</h3>

      <p>Researchers in the field of route planning have noted that while methods based on partitioning have been successful for accelerating queries on road networks, adapting those methods to public transit networks is harder than expected <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-11">11</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>]</span>. One of the main differences is that road networks are, for the most part, topological networks. Public transit networks on the other hand are also inherently time-dependent, while road networks. On top of that, it is not even clear <em>what</em> exactly needs to be partitioned as different algorithms can require wildly different data models <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-13">13</a>]</span>.</p>

      <p>The Scalable Transfer Patterns <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-14">14</a>]</span> algorithm that aims to greatly reduce preprocessing times of the original Transfer Patterns <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-15">15</a>]</span> algorithm. The authors compared 4 different techniques to partition stops into clusters of roughly equal size: 1) k-Means using the stops’ geographical locations, 2) a merge-based clustering with a utility function that punishes big partitions and rewards pairs of partitions with high edge weights between them , 3) a general-purpose graph clustering algorithm called METIS <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-16">16</a>]</span>, and 4) a road partitioning method called PUNCH <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-17">17</a>]</span>. They found that k-Means, despite being completely oblivious to the network structure outperformed, outperformed both METIS and PUNCH while the merge-based approach performed the best of all. HypRAPTOR <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-13">13</a>]</span> is another route planning algorithm that uses METIS to partition the network graph, but it clusters trips instead of stops.</p>

      <h3 id="voronoi-diagrams">Voronoi Diagrams</h3>

      <p>Voronoi diagrams are one of the most fundamental data structures in computational geometry <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-18">18</a>]</span>. Although they can be applied to any metric space, we only consider Euclidean spaces in this paper for the sake of simplicity. Given a set of seed points in a Euclidean space, a Voronoi diagram partitions that space into regions so that each region contains exactly one seed point, and every point in a region is closer to that region’s seed point than to any other region’s. Formally this means that for a given Euclidean space <script type="math/tex">X</script> with distance function <script type="math/tex">d</script>, and a set of seed points <script type="math/tex">P \subset X</script>, each point <script type="math/tex">p_i \in P</script> yields a corresponding Voronoi region <script type="math/tex">R_i \subseteq X</script> where</p>

      <script type="math/tex; mode=display">R_i = \{ x \in X \mid d(x, p_i) \leq d(x, p_j) \text{ for all } i \neq j  \}</script>

      <p>data publishers are not necessarily data owners</p>

      <ul>
        <li>data publisher may be hired by the data owner to publically disclose the data</li>
        <li>data publisher might republish data as a third party to meet specific requirements
          <ul>
            <li>some applications do not require fragmentations at all</li>
            <li>some applications might benefit from specific fragmentations (for example, by trip instead of by stop)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>regardless of the data publisher’s role – their service has to be maintainable to keep it cost-efficient</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the world is not static, it keeps evolving</li>
        <li>data published based on the real world has to evolve as well</li>
        <li>if the transit operator adds a stop, the published connections should accommodate this with as little friction as possible</li>
      </ul>

      <p>existing work has focused on distributing stops, or trips, into discrete sets</p>

      <ul>
        <li>problem with this approach is that the clustering has to be updated to include new stops, or risk going out of sync with the source data</li>
        <li>we propose to partition the physical space with Voronoi</li>
        <li>the resulting partitions are published separately as their own resource, described as WKT literals</li>
        <li>connections server can ingest any partition description, fragment the source data accordingly, and generate a hydra:PartialCollectionView per partition, the tree ontology is used to describe which partial view corresponds to which geospatial partition</li>
      </ul>

      <p>clustering</p>

      <p>Is it even desirable to use highly balanced clusters? Does that reflect how the data is used?</p>

      <h3 id="cacheability">Cacheability</h3>

      <p>no considerable change in total data size, so a cache that is big enough to cache the original data can also cache the partitioned data</p>

      <p>One thing that does change is how fast the cache will fill up - you need at least one request per fragment to fill up a web cache.</p>

      <p>The different partitioning schemes will also diverge when the cache is too small to contain all the data. Filling a cache with fine-grained data will take longer, but the cached data is more likely to be relevant. For example, a purely temporal fragmentation strategy will contain data for the entire operator’s service area, even if one region is significantly less often requested.</p>

      <p>To evaluate how fast a cache is filled we replay a small amount of requests on an empty cache, and do this many times. To evaluate how often relevant data is evicted from the cache we do the same, but on an already warmed up cache.</p>
